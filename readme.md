# ComplexSystems_playground

A sandbox of small projects exploring **complex systems** and **agent-based modeling (ABM)**.  
Each subfolder contains an independent simulation with its own configuration and visuals.

## Contents
- **Schelling Segregation Model** – How local preferences create large-scale patterns.
- **Cellular Automata** – Simple rules, complex behavior.
- More experiments coming soon.

## Requirements
Python 3.7+ and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
