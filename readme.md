# 🧩 Complex Systems Simulations

Welcome to a curated collection of **complex systems** and **agent-based modeling (ABM)** projects — a sandbox for exploring emergent phenomena, dynamical behaviors, and foundational computational models.  
Each subfolder hosts a standalone simulation with code, configuration and visualization.

| 🏘️ [**Schelling Segregation**](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/schelling-abm) | Demonstrates how individual local preferences lead to emergent large-scale spatial segregation patterns. |
| 🦌 [**Predator-Prey**](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/predator-prey)     | Models dynamic interactions between predators and prey, showcasing population oscillations and spatial complexity. |
| 🎲 [**Conway's Game of Life**](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/conway-game-of-life)          | Classic 2D cellular automaton illustrating how simple rules produce complex emergent behavior. |
