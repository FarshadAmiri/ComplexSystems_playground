# Complex Systems Simulations

A sandbox of small projects exploring **complex systems** and **agent-based modeling (ABM)**.  
Each subfolder contains an independent simulation with its own configuration and visuals.

## Simulations
- **Schelling Segregation Model** – How local preferences create large-scale patterns.
- **Predator-Prey Simulation** – Predator–Prey dynamic complex system simulation.
- **Conway's Game of Life** – A popular 2D cellular automaton.
