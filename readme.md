# üß© Complex Systems Simulations

Welcome to a curated collection of **complex systems** and **agent-based modeling (ABM)** projects ‚Äî a sandbox for exploring emergent phenomena, dynamical behaviors, and foundational computational models.  
Each subfolder hosts a standalone simulation complete with configuration, code, and visualization.

| üèòÔ∏è **Schelling Segregation Model** | Demonstrates how individual local preferences lead to emergent large-scale spatial segregation patterns. | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/schelling-abm) |
| ü¶å **Predator-Prey Simulation**     | Models dynamic interactions between predators and prey, showcasing population oscillations and spatial complexity. | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/predator-prey) |
| üé≤ **Conway's Game of Life**          | Classic 2D cellular automaton illustrating how simple rules produce complex emergent behavior. | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/conway-game-of-life) |
